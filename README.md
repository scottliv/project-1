# Alhoha Apparel

My first project at Red Academy, that focuses on html and css to make a static webpage.

## Project Features

Makes use of HTML 5 semantic tags and CSS3 flexbox properties to implement a responsive design that is optimized for three different screen sizes: mobile, 600px and 1240px. The nav bar uses jQuery to implement a smooth scroll feature and the image gallery uses flickity, a jQuery plugin.

## Deployment

Hosted on github pages @ https://scottliv.github.io/project-1/

## Built With
HTML CSS Javascript


## Authors

Scott Livingstone


## Acknowledgments
